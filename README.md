## What is BlueJammer-V2?

BlueJammer-V2 is a two-board RF research platform built around the **ESP32-WROOM-32U** and the **Ai-Thinker BW16** (RTL8720DN). It is the direct successor to the original [ESP32-BlueJammer](https://github.com/EmenstaNougat/ESP32-BlueJammer), bringing a completely reworked architecture, a live 5GHz web interface, a 128x64 OLED display, a quad NRF24L01 jamming engine, and a robust UART communication layer between both boards.

> This project is **closed source** and provided as pre-compiled firmware only. The source code is not publicly available. If you purchased this device from anyone other than official sources at [emensta.pages.dev](https://emensta.pages.dev) - **you have been scammed.**

---

## Architecture

BlueJammer-V2 runs across two boards, each with a dedicated role:

| Board | Role |
|---|---|
| **ESP32-WROOM-32U** | Jamming engine, OLED display, button, LED |
| **Ai-Thinker BW16** | 5GHz WiFi AP, web interface, UART master |

They communicate over a **UART link at 115200 baud** using a lightweight protocol with handshaking, command acknowledgement, and live error detection.

---

## Features

### Jamming Engine (ESP32)
- **Up to 4x NRF24L01+ modules** running simultaneously in a dynamic round-robin hop pattern
- Modules are hot-pluggable - the probe task detects connect/disconnect every 500ms and redistributes hops automatically so 1, 2, 3, or 4 radios always run at full capacity
- **4 jamming modes:**
  - `Mode 1` - Bluetooth (2.4GHz, CH 0-79)
  - `Mode 2` - BLE (2.4GHz, CH 0-39)
  - `Mode 3` - WiFi (2.4GHz, CH 0-14)
  - `Mode 4` - RC/Drone (2.4GHz, CH 0-125)
- Dual SPI buses (HSPI + VSPI) with NRF3 sharing HSPI via separate CE/CSN
- Built to squeeze every bit of processing power out of the ESP32 - the jamming engine runs completely separately from the UI, UART, and display tasks with zero interference between them

### Web Interface (BW16)
- Hosted on a **5GHz WiFi AP** (default channel 149, configurable)
- Full real-time mode control with live status polling every 300ms
- NRF module status (R1 / R2 / R3 / R4 - OK or FAIL), updated live as modules are plugged or unplugged
- Serial monitor built into the web UI - shows real ESP32 serial output forwarded over UART
- Command log
- **AP Settings panel** - change SSID, password, channel, hidden mode
- **OLED panel** - adjust brightness (0-100% in steps of 10, live preview), screen timeout with fade-out, I2C address selector
- **Preferences panel** - boot mode selector (idle or direct into a specific mode)
- **UART error overlay** - animated red notification slides in from the top if the ESP32 link drops mid-session, clears automatically on reconnect
- 5-minute AP auto-shutdown with a 10-second countdown if no browser connects
- Safety notice - if the AP is configured on a 2.4GHz channel, a warning banner is shown. Jamming still works but you will lose the web connection the moment a mode is activated. Use the physical button on the ESP32 to stop and reconnect. Using a 5GHz channel (default: 149) avoids this entirely.

### OLED Display (128x64)
- Boot splash screen
- Live status bar - NRF module indicators, web connection cloud icon, activity icons
- Mode screens with icon and label for each jamming mode
- Settings screen when web settings panel is open
- AP timeout countdown shown in the status bar (last 10 seconds)
- Configurable brightness (0-100%, live from web UI) with smooth fade-out on dim
- Configurable screen timeout with automatic power-off and fade effect
- Screen wakes on physical button press only when timed out

### BW16 LED Feedback
The onboard RGB LED on the BW16 communicates device state visually:

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Slow blue breathe | Waiting for web connection |
| Mode colour solid | Active jamming mode (Blue=BT, Green=BLE, Orange=WiFi, Purple=RC) |
| Red breathe | Idle |
| Cyan breathe | Settings panel open |
| Cyan strobe | Browser just connected |
| Green/Orange/Red blink | AP 10s countdown (colour changes by urgency) |
| Rapid R+B flash | AP shutting down |
| Distinct warning pattern | No ESP32 detected on UART |
| 3x green flash | ESP32 link restored after disconnect |

### UART Communication
Both boards use a live bidirectional heartbeat system. The ESP32 sends a `HB` pulse every 2 seconds, the BW16 replies, and the ESP32 confirms both directions are working with a `LINKOK` message. If either wire goes down, the BW16 detects it within 5 seconds and shows a UART error overlay on the web interface and activates the warning LED pattern. The link recovers automatically the moment the connection is restored.

## Hardware Requirements

### Core Components

| Component | Quantity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ESP32-WROOM-32 | 1 | Any module that covers the required pinout |
| Ai-Thinker BW16 | 1 | RTL8720DN, 5GHz capable |
| NRF24L01+ modules | 1-4 | With 10µF capacitor on each VCC/GND |
| SSD1306 OLED 128x64 | 1 | I2C, address 0x3C (or 0x3D, configurable) |
| LED | 1 | External, connected to GPIO27 |
| Decoupling capacitors | 1-4 | 10µF electrolytic, one per NRF module |

### Power
- Both boards share **3.3V and GND**
- The BW16 can be powered directly from the ESP32's 3V3 rail
- NRF24L01 modules are **very sensitive to power noise** - the 10µF capacitor on each module is not optional

## Flashing

Pre-compiled firmware is included in the `Firmware-Flasher` folder. A ready-to-run batch flasher is included for Windows.

### What you need
All files must be in the **same folder**:

**ESP32:**
- `BlueJammer-V2.ino.bin`
- `BlueJammer-V2.ino.bootloader.bin`
- `BlueJammer-V2.ino.partitions.bin`
- `esptool.exe`

**BW16:**
- `km0_boot_all.bin`
- `km4_boot_all.bin`
- `km0_km4_image2.bin`
- `amebatool.exe`
- `imgtool_flashloader_amebad.bin`

### Flashing ESP32
1. Connect ESP32 via USB
2. Run `BlueJammer-V2-Flasher_RUN_THIS.bat`
3. Select your COM port
4. Choose `1` for ESP32
5. The flasher handles everything automatically

### Flashing BW16
1. Put BW16 into **download mode:**
   - Hold the **BURN** button
   - Press and release **RST**
   - Release **BURN**
2. Run `BlueJammer-V2-Flasher_RUN_THIS.bat`
3. Select your COM port
4. Choose `2` for BW16
5. Press any key when ready

---

## First Boot

1. Flash both boards
2. Power on the ESP32 first, then the BW16 (or both simultaneously)
3. The BW16 creates a **5GHz WiFi AP:**
   - **SSID:** `BlueJ-V2_by_@emensta`
   - **Password:** `NoConn1337`
4. Connect to the AP and open `http://192.168.1.1`
5. The OLED on the ESP32 shows the current mode and radio status
6. The BW16 RGB LED confirms connection state

> The AP auto-shuts down after **5 minutes** if no browser connects. A 10-second countdown is shown on the OLED before shutdown. This can be adjusted in the firmware.

---

## Web Interface Usage

Once connected to the AP:

- **Mode buttons** - select Bluetooth, BLE, WiFi, RC, or Idle
- **NRF status** - shows which of the 4 modules are detected and operational
- **Serial monitor** - live output from the ESP32 over UART
- **Command log** - history of mode changes sent from the browser
- **Settings (gear icon)** - AP SSID, password, channel, and preferences
- **UART error overlay** - appears if the ESP32 link drops, with a dismiss button

---

## Troubleshooting

**OLED not turning on**
- Check SDA/SCL wiring (GPIO4/5)
- Verify I2C address - default is 0x3C, some displays use 0x3D (adjustable in OLED settings panel)
- If brightness was set to 0% the screen will be off - adjust in the web UI OLED panel

**NRF modules showing FAIL**
- Check wiring and the 10µF decoupling capacitor
- Modules are detected live every 500ms - they will appear as soon as connected
- All 4 modules are managed independently - NRF1 and NRF3 share HSPI, NRF2 and NRF4 share VSPI, each with unique CE and CSN pins

**BW16 not connecting to UART**
- Verify TX/RX are crossed correctly
- ESP32 UART: GPIO26 (RX) ← BW16 PB1, GPIO33 (TX) → BW16 PB2
- Both boards share GND - this is required
- The BW16 shows a distinct warning LED pattern and the web UI shows an error overlay if the UART link goes down
- The link is checked live in both directions - if only one wire is connected it will still be detected as a fault

**Web interface not loading**
- Confirm you are connected to the BW16's AP (5GHz capable device required)
- Default AP: `BlueJ-V2_by_@emensta` / `NoConn1337`
- Navigate to `http://192.168.1.1`
- The AP shuts down after 5 minutes if no browser connects - reset the BW16 to restart the window

**BW16 serial disconnects after AP starts**
- This is a known AmebaD SDK behaviour - the WiFi driver briefly resets the UART peripheral during `apbegin()`. The firmware calls `Serial.begin()` again immediately after to restore the connection. Close and reopen the serial monitor if needed.
